    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>(I am a freshman at OSU Cascades currently working towards a major in mechanical engineering. I have been enjoying my classes here although the challenges are quite extreme. I have not worked in any jobs relating to this yet. I have worked as a part time employee for two years at a movie theater. Problem solving is often something I face while on the job. Not of the computer problem type but the customer service kind. I come from a working family and enjoy the math side of engineering.)</p>

    <h2>Experience</h2>
    <p>I have not done projects relating to mechanical engineering. Although I have done some projects in the genre of engineering. At DIY Cave where I learned how to make simple constructions like a trebuchet. Learning to measure wood using tools and other skills regarding the process. During this summer I also built a ski ramp with a friend of mine in his backyard that did indeed hold our weight.

        <h2>Skills</h2>
        <p>I have good customer service skills after working directly with guests at my job for a few years now. I have dealt with countless situations where guests either cause a problem or encounter a problem that I must resolve. I have learned how to count change from my job aswell.
